# ForeverTime
This plugin finally lets you choose time between day or night in written level and stops the time forever until the server has been stopped. /reload compatible

## How do you set the time on specific level to night or to day? 
First, do /timestuck <level> <day|night>, and the time on the level that you wrote will be set to day or night and stops the time. Even tested with /reload. If you want to start the time again, do /time start (untested) or stop the server and then restart it.
